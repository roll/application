The ODE allows you to organize your data into folders. To do it, click the **Create folder** button located on the sidebar, below the **Upload your data** function:

![Create folder button](./assets/creating-folders/create-folder-button.png)

Now, provide a name for the new folder:

![Name of the folder](./assets/creating-folders/Name-of-the-folder.png)

To add files in the folder, click on the name of the new folder and then go to  **Upload your data**. 

**Note:** The current version of the ODE does not allow users to move files to folder.
